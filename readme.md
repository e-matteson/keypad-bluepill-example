# keypad-bluepill-example

A simple example of how to use the [keypad](https://github.com/e-matteson/keypad) driver on an actual microcontroller. 

The driver itself is platform-agnostic, but this example specifically runs on a [blue pill](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill) board with an STM32 Cortex M3 microcontroller.

You must use nightly rust, and install the `thumbv7m-none-eabi` target.
